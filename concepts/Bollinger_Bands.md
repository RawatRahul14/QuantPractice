### Bollinger Bands

**What are Bollinger Bands?**

**Bollinger Bands** are a popular technical analysis tool developed by John Bollinger. They consist of three lines plotted on a price chart:

- A simple moving average (SMA), usually set to 20 periods.
- An upper band, calculated as a fixed number of standard deviations above the SMA.
- A lower band, calculated as the same number of standard deviations below the SMA.

These bands dynamically adjust to the market's volatility, expanding during high volatility and contracting during low volatility.

**Bollinger Bands** are a powerful technical analysis tool used by traders to understand market volatility, price levels, and potential overbought or oversold conditions. They are useful because they offer insights into price behavior relative to its historical volatility and are effective in identifying potential market opportunities.

**Why is it useful?**

1. Identifying Overbought and Oversold Conditions:
    - The distance between the **Upper Band** (typically set at 2 standard deviations above the moving average) and the **Lower Band** (2 standard deviations below) provides a range where prices typically trade.
    - **Price touches the Upper Band**: Often interpreted as an **overbought condition**, suggesting that the price may be due for a pullback or reversal.
    - **Price touches the Lower Band**: Suggests an **oversold condition**, indicating that the price may be due for a rebound.

2. Trend Reversals and Breakouts:
    - Bollinger Bands are often used to detect trend reversals or breakouts. When the price moves outside the bands (especially the upper band for bullish signals and the lower band for bearish signals), it can indicate a potential trend reversal or breakout.
    - Band Squeeze: When the bands contract (narrow range), it often signals an upcoming increase in volatility, indicating a potential breakout.

3. Price Trend Confirmation:
    - When prices remain near the **Upper Band** for an extended period, it suggests the current trend is strong and upward.
    - When prices remain near the **Lower Band**, it can indicate a strong downward trend.

4. Combining with Other Indicators:
    - Traders often combine **Bollinger Bands** with other indicators, like the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, to increase accuracy. For example, if a stock is at the **Lower Band** and the **RSI is below 30** (typically indicating oversold conditions), the stock may be an **attractive buy**.

**Bollinger Bands Formula:**

1. **Middle Band:** This is a simple moving average (SMA)

$$
\text{Middle Band} = SMA_n
$$

where: 
$\text{n}$ is the number of periods (commonly 20).

2. **Upper Band:** 

$$
\text{Upper Band} = SMA_a + \text{k . } \sigma
$$

where:
- $\sigma$: Standard Deviation of the price over $\text{n}$ periods.
- $\text{k}$: A multiplier (commonly set to 2).

3. **Upper Band:** 

$$
\text{Lower Band} = SMA_a - \text{k . } \sigma
$$
