### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**What is Relative Strength Index?**

The **Relative Strength Index** is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and magnitude of an asset's recent price changes. It helps traders identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

**Why is it useful?**

1. Identifying Overbought and Oversold conditions:
    - **Overbought (RSI > 70):** When the RSI indicates overbought levels, it suggests that the price has risen too quickly and might be due for a pullback or correction. This can help traders consider selling or shorting the asset.

    - **Oversold (RSI < 30):** When the RSI sginals oversold levels, it suggests that the price has fallen excessively and might be due for a rebound. This helps the trader consider buying or going long.

2. Momentum Confirmation:
    - A rising RSI in an uptrend confirms strong buying momentum.
    - A falling RSI in a downtrend confirms strong selling momentum.

3. RSI is effective in spotting **bullish** or **bearish divergences**, which occur when the RSI and price move in opposite directions.

    - **Bullish Divergence:** RSI rises while the price continues to fall, indicating potential upward momentum.
    - **Bearish Divergence:** RSI falls while the price continues to rise, indicating potential downward momentum.

**RSI Formula:**

$$
\text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1+\text{RS}}
$$

where:
- RS: Relative Strength, calculated as:

$$
\text{RS} = \frac{\text{Average Gain over n periods}}{\text{Average Loss over n periods}}
$$

- $\text{n}$: The number of periods (commonly 14 days in standard RSI calculations). (But in the codes it is taken 20 days)
